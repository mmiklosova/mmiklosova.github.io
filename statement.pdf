USC Calender:

	USC houses a wide array of students from diverse ethnicities, as well as clubs and organizations. 
    The majority of these different groups come together and schedule times to interact through Garnet Gate. 
    This is a valuable tool for showing what is happening and where, but it fails to provide a calendar resource. 
    These events are presented in a list format, which is confusing and makes it hard to determine which events 
    students should attend. In addition, there is no official school calendar of the breaks and final exam dates.
    The dates listed on USC's website are difficult to memorize and pose a significant time management challenge 
    for students. In other institutions, they provide a calendar layout including a way to add to both Google and 
    Apple calendars. This would enhance the USC experience and cause greater organization.
